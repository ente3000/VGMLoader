Depending on your use case, please use [VGMLoaderX](https://github.com/TheLastZombie/userscripts/#vgmloaderx-), the [youtube-dl extractor](https://github.com/TheLastZombie/VGMLoader/issues/6#issuecomment-786627407), one of the [other downloaders](https://github.com/search?q=khinsider&s=stars) out there, [donate](https://downloads.khinsider.com/forums/index.php?account/upgrades) to enable native batch downloading for your account or use [another site](https://www.sittingonclouds.net/).**

Automatically downloads albums from [KHInsider](https://downloads.khinsider.com/), because that feature is currently behind a paywall.

Check out the [Releases](https://github.com/TheLastZombie/VGMLoader/releases) tab for Windows executables and source code downloads!

If you're familiar with the command line and prefer youtube-dl for downloading, you can also use [my extractor](https://github.com/TheLastZombie/VGMLoader/blob/master/khinsider.py).

There is also a userscript which you can use with, for example, Tampermonkey, available [here](https://github.com/TheLastZombie/userscripts/#vgmloaderx-).

## Usage

1. Go to KHInsider and find an album.
2. Copy the URL and start VGMLoader.
3. Enter the URL and choose a codec.
4. Configure the destination folder.
5. Select a preferred download program.
6. Have a cup of tea. üçµ
